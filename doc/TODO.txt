This is a general todo list because we don't use an issue tracker like 
civilized folks do. Many many things are broken because we also don't use a
test framework like civilized folks do. But now we have a pre-commit hook so
use that!

Due to lots of churn at the kernel level and not at all enough testing, many
of the apps and demos do not actually work.

Things that work:
- Questionaire
- Piping
- Lambda
- StateMachine

Things that don't work:
- batches (update factory and interp. need to re-vitalize Jaba)
- EnsoSync (lots of changes)
- security (update factory and interp)
- web (???)
- Northwind (depend on web, security, AND batches. fix last)
- Geometry (should be easy fix)
- Todo
- Petstore


We need to fix the things that don't work (usually by renaming a path or class)
and add their tests to test/runall.rb AND make sure *everybody* uses the 
pre-commit hook to test before commiting.


What to try when something doesn't work (generally in this order):

- The path names are probably wrong. Things were moved around between the
  following directories (all relative to enso/src):
    > ../demos/
    > apps/
    > test/samples/

  Soln: Check the requires path and update accordingly

- Class names are wrong. Javascript translation requires all affected files to
  contain exactly one Module. Many core files were affected (notably 
  Factory::SchemaFactory) and references to them were not all updated.

  Soln: Update class names correctly. Factory's methods were not changed.

- Interpreter framework was changed. The core interpreter framework at
  core/semantics/code/interpreter has been re-designed several times. All 
  interpreters use it, but not every interpreter was updated to use the latest
  one.

  Soln: Very involved. Need to restructure interpreters to use the latest 
  interpreter framework. The best example to copy lives in core/expr/code/eval.
  You will need ${DIETY_OF_CHOICE}'s blessing in this Herculean task.

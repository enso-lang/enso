Enso Developer Guide
====================

This guide assumes knowledge of how Enso works and the use of schema and 
grammar together with the interpreter framework. The purpose of this document
is to help navigate its code base and how to do things 'the right way'.

1) Source code organization
---------------------------
Important locations in the source tree:

src/          -- where the source code and the magic happens
experimental/ -- experimental side-projects
doc/          -- additional docs. Most modules have them
lib/          -- compiled binaries that are depended on. Mostly Jaba stuff

src/core         -- Core Enso modules. Include schema, grammar, stencil 
                    (diagram), etc DSLs.
src/core/system  -- Enso kernel, only part that is *not* a DSL. Self-hosting
                    bootstrap module that loads the initial schema.schema quad
                    diagram and handles the caching.
src/core/semantics -- Interpreter framework for Enso. Currently also *not* a 
                      DSL but it should be. Has to merge into core/lang/.

src/app       -- Non-essential Enso modules. These are used by other modules 
                 but some can be standalone apps as well.

src/demo      -- Full-fledged applications for demo. No module should depend on
                 anything in demo.

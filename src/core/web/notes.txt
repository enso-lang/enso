There are various ways to do the UI. 
For simplicity, i'll do a progressive selection
idea, with right-click menus.

* text field changes mapped back to source
* drop-down list (with conditions from source)
    - finding conditions that apply!
* delete actions
* insert actions (this is the most difficult?)
* saving (source and diagram)
* loading (and merging the saved diagram)
    - needs to have standard "address" for objects
* editing points of a connector 
    - positions
    - add/remove points

# simple test case to ensure that the point (5,5) is not painted
# dd2 violates this because Drawing2 has a line (1,3)-(9,7) that passes thru (5,5)

# The smallest change that can correct this is to modify EITHER coordinate in
# the second point to its original values, ie.
# EITHER mod-(9,-) to change (1,3)-(7,8) to (1,3)-(9,8)
# OR     mod-(-,7) to change (1,3)-(7,8) to (1,3)-(7,7)
# actually, BOTH solutions are misleading, as the whole point needs to be changed
# but this is an inherent weakness of delta-debugging's blackbox approach

# However, due to the quirks in the matching algorithm (unable to match keyless pts)
# the modification on the point was recorded as an insert + delete. Thus the final
# returned result is add-(9,7)

# we can also attempt to localize the bug without a baseline model
